## scVisualizeR

A simple package with a few functions for scRNAseq gene expression visualization. Designed as an addon for Monocle3 (https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/). 


Install scVisualizeR using the following:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('jaugust7/scVisualizeR')
```
Note: This package is still in development and was designed to make my life easier. It may need tweaking in order to work in your workflow. I'll add updates as I'm made aware of bugs that prevent it working on other setups.

Cheers!
